# Lab. #1

**Topic:** Introduction to the Interface and Features of Linux OS

**Purpose of the Work:**
Gaining practical skills in working with Linux OS and mobile OS environments â€“ including their graphical interface, logging in and out of the system, familiarizing with the desktop structure, and learning the basic operations and settings for working within the system.

## Main task

### 1. Working in Graphical Mode in Linux OS

#### 1.1 Choose a Graphical Shell for a Linux OS to Review. Examine the structure of the user workspace and describe its main components.

- **Main menu.** The main menu in KDE, called Kickoff, is in the bottom-left corner by default. It provides access to installed applications, system settings, and recent files. Users can browse applications by category or use the search function to find what they need quickly. KDE also offers alternatives like the Application Dashboard, which presents a full-screen launcher, and Simple Menu, which offers a more minimalistic approach.
- **Quick access.** KDE uses a taskbar to display open applications, allowing users to switch between them easily. It supports grouping, window previews, and pinning frequently used applications.
- **Search.** Main search system is KRunner. Activated by pressing Alt + Space, KRunner allows users to launch applications, open files, perform calculations, search online, and execute commands.
- **Virtual desktops creation.** KDE supports multiple virtual desktops, allowing users to organize their workspace efficiently. Users can switch between them using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + F1 to Ctrl + F4 by default) or via the desktop switcher widget. Or by using Activities.

#### 1.2 Applications execution

- Via quick access

### 2. 

## Control questions



## Conclusion

During the laboratory work, we explored the interface and capabilities of the Linux operating system, including graphical environments and the command line. We learned to perform basic operations such as launching applications, switching between virtual consoles, changing users, and shutting down the system.
