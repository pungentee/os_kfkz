## Answers to control questions

## Conclusion

We gained practical experience in Linux system administration using the Bash command-line interface. We worked together on tasks such as creating users and groups, modifying file and directory permissions, applying special permissions like setuid, setgid, and sticky bit, and exploring hard and symbolic links. These activities strengthened our understanding of Linux file security and system management.
