| **OS Kernel Architecture** | **Hybrid Kernel (XNU - X is Not Unix)**                                     | **Hybrid Kernel (XNU - X is Not Unix)**                           |
|                            | - Combines features of monolithic and microkernel architectures.            | - Same kernel as macOS, but optimized for mobile devices.         |
|                            | - Derived from Mach and BSD.                                                | - Derived from Mach and BSD.                                      |
|                            | - Supports multitasking and multi-user environments.                        | - Optimized for low-power, single-user mobile devices.            |
| **User Interface**         | **Desktop-Oriented GUI**                                                    | **Touch-Oriented GUI**                                            |
|                            | - Designed for use with a mouse, keyboard, and trackpad.                    | - Designed for touch input (gestures, swipes, taps).              |
|                            | - Features a menu bar, dock, and window-based multitasking.                 | - Features a home screen with app icons, no traditional menu bar. |
|                            | - Supports multiple displays and complex window management.                 | - Optimized for single-screen use with limited multitasking.      |
| **System Calls**           | **POSIX-Compliant**                                                         | **POSIX-Compliant**                                               |
|                            | - Uses BSD-based system calls.                                              | - Uses BSD-based system calls, but with additional restrictions.  |
|                            | - Full access to system resources for developers (with proper permissions). | - Limited access to system resources for security (sandboxing).   |
|                            | - Supports advanced system-level APIs for desktop applications.             | - Focuses on mobile-specific APIs (e.g., CoreMotion, ARKit).      |
